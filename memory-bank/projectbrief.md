# Project Brief: AI-Powered Ransomware Detection System

## Overview
This project is an advanced ransomware detection system that uses deep learning to identify potentially malicious files based on their attributes and behaviors. The system provides both a modern web interface for interactive file analysis and batch processing capabilities.

## Core Requirements
1. Accurate detection of ransomware through machine learning models
2. User-friendly interface for file analysis
3. Batch processing support for CSV uploads
4. Dashboard for visualizing prediction metrics
5. Model training capabilities through the interface

## Goals
- Create a reliable tool for cybersecurity professionals to identify potential ransomware
- Provide insights into file characteristics that may indicate malicious intent
- Allow for efficient processing of multiple files through batch uploads
- Enable visualization of detection metrics and model performance
- Support model training and fine-tuning to improve detection accuracy

## Project Scope
The system consists of:
1. React-based frontend for user interaction
2. FastAPI backend for processing requests and hosting ML models
3. SQLite database for storing prediction history and model metadata
4. Machine learning models trained on ransomware datasets

## Success Criteria
- Detection accuracy above 95%
- User-friendly interface with intuitive workflows
- Efficient batch processing capabilities
- Comprehensive dashboard with relevant metrics
- Model training functionality available through the UI
