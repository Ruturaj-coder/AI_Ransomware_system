# Project Progress

## What Works
Based on the codebase exploration:

1. **Backend API**
   - FastAPI framework is set up with proper routing
   - Endpoints for predictions, batch processing, and model training
   - Database integration with SQLite and SQLAlchemy
   - Core ML model integration
   - Static analysis for JavaScript files

2. **Frontend Application**
   - React application with Tailwind CSS styling
   - Multiple pages for different functionalities
   - Form components for data input
   - API integration with backend services
   - Code content analysis interface

3. **Machine Learning**
   - Neural network model for binary classification
   - Data preprocessing pipeline
   - Model training and evaluation
   - Feature importance analysis

4. **Content Analysis**
   - Static analysis for JavaScript files
   - Detection of common obfuscation techniques
   - Pattern-based suspicious code identification
   - Suspicion score calculation
   - Dedicated content analysis page
   - Integration with prediction workflow

## Current Status
The project has successfully implemented the File Content Analysis feature with both backend and frontend components. We are now planning to implement two more enhancement features:

1. **File Content Analysis** (✓ Implemented)
   - Static code analysis for script files (JavaScript)
   - Detection of obfuscated malicious code
   - API endpoints for analysis
   - Pattern matching system for suspicious constructs
   - Suspicion score calculation
   - Dedicated analysis page
   - Integration with prediction workflow

2. **Automated Model Retraining** (In Planning)
   - Scheduled periodic retraining
   - Performance evaluation and comparison
   - Model versioning

3. **Reporting System** (Planned)
   - PDF report generation
   - Detection reasoning visualization
   - Customizable templates

## Known Issues
Without testing the application, potential issues cannot be confirmed, but based on the code review:
- Limited error handling in some areas
- Lack of authentication for sensitive operations
- Dataset imbalance handling could potentially be improved
- Limited testing evident in the codebase
- File Content Analysis is currently limited to JavaScript files
- Performance impact of analyzing large JavaScript files not measured

## What's Left to Build

### Immediate Focus (Enhancement Features)
1. **File Content Analysis** (✓ Completed)
   - ✓ Static analysis module for script files
   - ✓ Obfuscation detection patterns
   - ✓ API endpoints for analysis
   - ✓ Integration with prediction workflow
   - ✓ Frontend updates to display results
   - ✓ Dedicated analysis page

2. **Automated Model Retraining**
   - Scheduler implementation
   - Data collection mechanism
   - Performance evaluation system
   - Model versioning
   - Admin UI for configuration

3. **Reporting System**
   - PDF generation module
   - Report templates and visualizations
   - Download functionality
   - Frontend integration

### Future Enhancements
1. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - User accounts and login system
   - Role-based access control

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Real-time file monitoring
   - Integration with security tools
   - Export functionality for reports
   - Additional ML models for comparison
   - Expand File Content Analysis to support more file types

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Containerization with Docker
   - Cloud deployment configuration
   - CI/CD pipeline

4. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for backend functions
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - End-to-end tests for user workflows

## Current Milestone
The project has completed the File Content Analysis feature both in the backend and frontend. The feature is available through a dedicated page and integrated into the prediction workflow. JavaScript files can now be analyzed for suspicious patterns and the results are displayed visually. The next step is to implement the Automated Model Retraining feature.
