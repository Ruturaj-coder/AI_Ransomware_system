# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is transitioning from exploration to enhancement phase. We have implemented the File Content Analysis feature and integrated it into the website, making it available through both a dedicated page and as part of the prediction workflow.

## Recent Discoveries
- The project is an AI-powered ransomware detection system using deep learning
- Frontend is built with React.js and Tailwind CSS
- Backend is implemented with FastAPI in Python
- ML models use TensorFlow for deep learning and scikit-learn for preprocessing
- The system supports both individual file analysis and batch processing
- File Content Analysis is now integrated into the website

## Key Components Identified
1. **Backend API**: Handles predictions, model training, metrics, and now file content analysis
2. **Deep Learning Model**: Neural network for ransomware classification
3. **Frontend Pages**: Home, Predict, Upload, Train, Dashboard, BatchHistory, CodeAnalysis
4. **Data Visualization**: Charts and metrics for model performance
5. **Static Analysis**: JavaScript file analysis for suspicious patterns

## Planned Enhancements
We have implemented the File Content Analysis feature and are planning to implement the remaining two major feature enhancements:

1. **File Content Analysis** ✓
   - Static code analysis for script files ✓
   - Detection of obfuscated malicious code ✓
   - Pattern matching for suspicious constructs ✓
   - Integration with existing prediction workflow ✓
   - Frontend interface for analyzing script files ✓

2. **Automated Model Retraining**
   - Scheduled periodic retraining with new samples
   - Performance evaluation and model comparison
   - Model versioning system
   - Admin interface for retraining configuration

3. **Reporting System**
   - Detailed PDF report generation
   - Visualizations of detection reasoning
   - Feature importance explanations
   - Customizable report templates

## Active Decisions
- File Content Analysis feature has been implemented with JavaScript file support
- We focused on common obfuscation and suspicious patterns used in malicious JavaScript
- The feature is accessible through both a dedicated page and as part of the prediction workflow
- We created a reusable component for displaying analysis results
- The analysis score is integrated with the overall prediction result for JavaScript files

## Open Questions
- Current model performance and accuracy metrics
- Dataset characteristics and balance
- Deployment status and requirements
- Testing strategy and test coverage
- Potential security considerations

## Next Steps
1. Implement Automated Model Retraining
   - Create scheduler functionality for periodic model training
   - Add model versioning support
   - Implement model performance comparison
   - Develop admin interface for configuration

2. Implement Reporting System (final feature)
   - Create PDF generation module
   - Develop report templates
   - Implement visualization of detection reasoning
   - Add download functionality
