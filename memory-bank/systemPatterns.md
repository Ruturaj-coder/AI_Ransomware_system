# System Patterns

## System Architecture
The system uses a layered architecture with clear separation between the frontend and backend:

```
Frontend (React.js) <---> Backend API (FastAPI) <---> ML Models/Database
```

### Key Components
1. **Frontend Application**: User interface built with React.js and Tailwind CSS
2. **Backend API**: REST API built with FastAPI that handles requests and processes data
3. **ML Model Layer**: Deep learning models for ransomware detection
4. **Data Storage**: SQLite database for storing predictions and model metadata

## Design Patterns

### Frontend Patterns
1. **Component-Based Architecture**: UI elements are organized as reusable React components
2. **Presentational and Container Components**: Separation between UI rendering and business logic
3. **React Hooks**: Used for state management and side effects
4. **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS for adaptive layouts across different devices

### Backend Patterns
1. **RESTful API**: Standard HTTP methods and endpoints for client-server communication
2. **Dependency Injection**: FastAPI's dependency injection system for clean code organization
3. **Repository Pattern**: Separation of data access logic from business logic
4. **Singleton Pattern**: For database connection and model management
5. **Factory Pattern**: For creating and managing ML model instances

### Machine Learning Patterns
1. **Model-as-a-Service**: ML models exposed as API endpoints
2. **Feature Preprocessing Pipeline**: Standardized data handling before model input
3. **Model Versioning**: Support for different model versions
4. **Transfer Learning**: Building on pre-trained models for better performance

## Component Relationships
- **Frontend-Backend**: Communication via REST API with JSON data exchange
- **Backend-Database**: SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations
- **Backend-ML Models**: Direct integration with TensorFlow/scikit-learn models

## Data Flow
1. User inputs file data through frontend
2. Request sent to backend API
3. Backend preprocesses data and applies ML model
4. Results stored in database
5. Response returned to frontend
6. Frontend displays prediction results to user

## Security Considerations
1. Input validation on both frontend and backend
2. CORS policies for API access control
3. Authentication (planned future implementation)
4. Data validation before model inference
